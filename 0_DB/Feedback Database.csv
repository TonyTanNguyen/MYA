FNB-20,FNB_Restaurant,Cai Mam Hoi Vu,2025-04-15,W249,Good,"that's a quite a new branch of Cai Mam we've been using for 3* guests for local/restaurant type of meal in Dao Duy Tu street. Located in an old house in a small street, could be good for small groups. However, for the big group like this they were a bit too uncoordinated. The food was good, we only ordered fried rice, fried noodles, and fried spring rolls as Lukasz K suggested. So in the end it was ok, but took much time ordering drinks, etc.",
FNB-19,FNB_Restaurant,Spice Garden Tam Coc,2025-04-15,W249,Good,"The owner forgot to recheck what Minh ordered for our group in the morning of the tour. So they served a different set than we ordered and had menus printed for. However they were hungry, and they liked the restaurant + the food, so they essentially cleaned the plates xD All super good, so the guests praised the food.",
FNB-18,FNB_Restaurant,Bia Hoi Lan Chin ,2025-04-15,W249,Good,"In the end good, but when we went in some ppl were just sitting, not eating. But I've convinced them to try everything and they did, some said it was the best food in the whole tour. However, as you can see - once again it turns out that if we keep the guests informed what to expect, they are easier to accept this form of eating. During the day I kept reminding them that dinner will be SUPER LOCAL with many Vietnamese ppl sitting around drinking beer and talking about life. So it was easier for them to accept.",

The bot itself was pretty old, wooden with smaller rooms/windows and no balconies. My rooms had at least 3 coackroaches (the ones I saw, must have had more...). The food was surprisingly tasty and fresh (I expected worse  ) and Mr Son (bartender) was one of the best bartenders I have seen on Halong boats, super funny and talkative. Cruise Manager lacking language skill but kudos to him as he did go on the kayak with everyone to show the route (doesn't happen much). OVerall, not recommended, too old. ",

Very efficient, fast front desk, plenty of space for bus and check in/check out.As the hotel is little older there were rooms which had some issues – noisy AC, some without AC turned on so feeling hot when getting in the room. One room had water pipe leak in the bathroom upon check in so it was changed immediately. ",
RST-41,RST_Resort,Grandis Hotels and Resorts,2025-05-13,L2143,Neutral,"hotel connected to Suria shopping mall. Just opposite Hyatt Centric and with great location, walking distance everywhere and excellent front desk staff. Rooms look a bit tired though (wooden furniture with lots of scratches) and the breakfast was so so, even though it had lots of items available. Rooftop pool and decent view from rooftop, but will be obstructed by the construction in front. It is ok, but certainly not the best, for higher standard and new property choose Hyatt Centric.",
RST-39,RST_Resort,Mulu Marriott Resort&Spa,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"really nice property surrounded by rainforest. The only place with a pool and basically the only hotel in the area. Rooms are build on concrete pillars well above the ground below (it may flood so using pillars), great upkeeep of the property and well trained staff. They have tasty buffet dinner included, and shuttle serive to the National Park HQ/gate operating 06:45-21:00. All airport transfers are included in the service too. Airport transfer takes 20minutes, usually with open truck that has benches and a roof (can fit ~14pax pax and luggage), National Park transfer is about 10minutes, for this one they use minibus 10seat. Quite expensive F&B for Malysian standards, food starting at 55MYR, beer is 35MYR",
HTL-33,HTL_Hotel,The Waterfront Hotel Kuching,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"Nice one. Large, comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast options and great location, just opposite pedestrian bridge over the river and with lots of historic buildings around. The hotel shares the same building with a shopping mall, so there's also plenty of shops, cafes and large grocery shop if you take the side entrance to the mall. ",
GDE-92,GDE_Guide,Mariea - DTH Malaysia ,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"a Malay-Indian guide with a pretty strong accent, who started on the weak side. I was getting a bit frustrated, but after getting to know each other I think it was a great experience to have someone with this insights into Hindu and Indian community. Great knowledge gains, as we usually work with Malay-Chinese guides and need to ask the Indian drivers of Lero Maju about more information related to Indian community. ",

GDE-90,GDE_Guide,Andy - DTH Malaysia ,2025-05-13,L2143,Bad,"a bit of disappointment. He started by telling us the itinerary of the 2 days and where he will leave us with the boatmen on the 2nd day (after visiting caves) as he will pick up other guests who will go trekking with him. When going around he would stay in front maintaining distance from us and just stopping where there was something to show. Certainly excellent knowledge of the area, but he seemed to be very distant. When visiting village he told us we can go to the market and read the information about the village on the boards... ",
GDE-89,GDE_Guide,Switchely (Michael) - DTH Malaysia ,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"great all around. Funny, great English, entertaining, knowledgable ",
ATC-33,ATC_Attraction,Semenggoh Wildlife Centre,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"we were lucky to see 3 orangutans, as it is not guaranteed to see them. They live in the forest and come to the feeding platforms when they feel they'd like to have some extra food. Now was a fruit season, so some days no orangutans are showing. The place has parking and 10min electric car transfer to the feeding platforms. You can opt to walk, but it is a little bit up and down, maybe 30min walk one way. It can get busy, when we visited I'd estimate about 100 ppl were there with us",
HTL-16,ATC_Attraction,Bako National Park,2025-05-13,L2143,Good,"very nice tours. For the longer treks it might be really tiring with the heat, therefore local guides will usually recommend shorter treks and just extend them a bit in time with more stops to learn about the forest",
HTL-16,HTL_Hotel,Bako National Park,2025-05-13,L2143,Neutral,"the air conditioned bungalows are OK, but it is still a pretty basic accommodation. The ones without AC are a stuffy, hot rooms with a ceiling fan. it gets pleasantly cool by the nighttime, but as you enter the room you don't want to stay inside, its too hot. Also no amenities in the rooms. I stayed in 'hostel' room which has beds only and shared toilets with cold showers. Canteen serves buffet lunch but I recommend to order a la carte (guests can choose option), then the food is going to be fresh. Meals are basic but tasty, beers and soft drinks available too. ",
ATC-31,ATC_Attraction,Mulu National Park,2025-05-13,L2143,Neutral,"standard tours here include day1 trek to Deer cave and watching bats + day2 clearwater cave (by boat). Deer cave trek is 3km trek one-way, following well maintained wooden walkway. It is lit after dark, so you can get back to National Park HQ even after dark without a torchlight. You leave about 3PM to visit Lang and Deer cave and watch millions of bats leaving the cave. Walk back before Sunset (about 1hr walk one way). The Clearwater cave tour is by longboats (6-7pax /each) with a stop at Penan village. You enter one cave, and then short boat ride to Clearwater which is super impressive. Tasty picnic lunch provided and you can swim in the river here. No towels are provided. Back to hotel after about 5hrs. You can add canopy walk (50MYR per pax) or night walk (30 MYR per pax) which need to be booked with National Park directly, join tours, 8pax maximum. Start and end point at the National Park. ",
ATC-13,ATC_Attraction,Kinabalu Park,2025-05-13,L2143,Neutral,"it is indeed a long drive if the tour combines Kinabalu Park and Poring Hot Springs. The drive to Park HQ is about 2 hours each way, but if you extend it to Poring Hot Springs it is another hour each way extra. DTH supposedly has 2 type of Kinabalu tours. One is just walking along the trails in the park (which I thought we're doing), the other one is 45min botanical loop walk and then going to Poring Hot Springs. It is extra drive but they have a nice canopy walk at the hot springs and you can dip your feet/body in the hot springs if you want to. To have a full bath it takes a lot of time, ideally 2hrs here as you need to fill up your bath first. The baths and swimming pool are charged extra, tour only includes foot soaking. Only local restaurant here, outside the gate which is pretty local with pink tablecloth and basic toilet. Nicer looking option is restaurant inside Poring Hot springs. Very near to hot springs is Rafflessia garden, which has high ticket (30MYR) but it is just on the roadside with plenty of flower buds in this particular spot, very high chance of seeing the flower.
